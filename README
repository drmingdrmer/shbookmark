	"gclean":

	"g key1 [key2 [key3..]]":
		Go to the directory specified by keywords key1, key2..

		If only one directory matched, it goes to the directory at
		once. Or it lists all matched direcotries for narrawing search.

		For example, "g" without argument shows:
		   1 --- ~/VCS/git/SAE_SDK_Linux_Mac/
		   2 --- ~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com
		   ...
		   7 --- ~/bash.xp/plugin/shbookmark

		Search For :


		"g VCS" shows:
		   1 --- ~/VCS/git/SAE_SDK_Linux_Mac/
		   2 --- ~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com
		(Press ENTER to select by number)
		Search For :

		Now adding another keyword "svn" it goes to
		"~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com".

		Search directory that matches "key1" without containing
		"key2".
