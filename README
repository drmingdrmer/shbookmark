Usage:
	"ga":
		Add `pwd` to bookmark

	"gdel":
		Delete `pwd` from bookmark

	"gclean":
		Delete all inexistent bookmark entries.

	"g key1 [key2 [key3..]]":
		Go to the directory specified by keywords key1, key2..

		If only one directory matched, it goes to the directory at
		once. Or it lists all matched direcotries for narrawing search.

		For example, "g" without argument shows:
		   1 --- ~/VCS/git/SAE_SDK_Linux_Mac/
		   2 --- ~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com
		   ...
		   7 --- ~/bash.xp/plugin/shbookmark
		(Press ENTER to select by number)
		Search For :


		"g VCS" shows:
		   1 --- ~/VCS/git/SAE_SDK_Linux_Mac/
		   2 --- ~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com
		(Press ENTER to select by number)
		Search For :

		Now adding another keyword "svn" it goes to
		"~/VCS/gitsvn/bbtt.com".

		The above working flow is equivalent to "g VCS gitsvn".

	"g key1 -key2":
		Search directory that matches "key1" without containing
		"key2".


Install:
	Add the following line to ~/.bashrc:
		source path_to_shbookmark/rc/bashrc

        User defined prefix can be optionally sepcified to replace the default
        "g".

        To use "bk" as prefix:
		source path_to_shbookmark/rc/bashrc bk
        Thus commands should be: "bkadd", "bkdel", "bkclean", "bk"

	export SHBOOKMARK_COLOR=1
